# ModVad_sentiment

ModVad is a rule-based sentiment tool specifically adjusted to the use of financial social media text. ModVad is based on the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) dictionary by Hutto & Gilbert (2014). Currently the dictionary is adapted to r/Wallstreetbets (WSB) but can be quickly modified to other social media sources.
